## Enhancement Category 1: Software Design and Engineering

The initial artifact for this submission was a package of files used in developing test cases for CS 320. This package was the final submission for that class and was completed in December of 2024. I chose to include this artifact in my portfolio because I felt that it was the most fleshed out piece of work that I had from a previous course that I could build upon. This artifact proved to be a basis for me in developing a final enhancement plan based on these initial classes and the structure of the information and methods. This resulted in the decision to create a full stack application for all three categories based loosely on these initial classes. The current initial artifact has yet to be improved as I realized during development for this stage that much of the class structure resembles the data model and intended schema for the information that will be help in the database. Since the intention is for the application to be a full stack application, a front end and framework had to be developed which was the focus of this first enhancement. By creating this front facing user interface and creating a full stack framework, I have made it easier to further improve on the artifact by translating the classes and methods to data models and routing methods that can later be used with a database to translate these classes into a practical application.

I did not fully meet the intended enhancement goals that I had set for this enhancement of translating the original classes into JavaScript as the resemblance to a data model made it more fitting for the second category enhancement. Instead, the focus became designing and developing a basic user side with elements to accept user input and further process queries or requests. Not all of this functionality was completed, in particular the design of the dropdown menu for the search component, but the ability to rapidly develop the artifact to this point was a large accomplishment.

The amount of design left to do with the UI elements themselves led me to leave more complex designs for later development and so my intention is to continuously update the interface as I continue developing the artifact for the remaining two categories. 
  
Looking at the course outcomes, I showed my ability to design visual communications through data flow diagrams and ER diagrams, and also demonstrated a learnign mindset and concerns for best practices by researching industry technologies and standards for testing and authentication in a full stack, and noting any results of my research in my informal tracker. Security was also at the forefront of my concerns in planning for proper authentication set up before connecting the database or publishing the site to prevent malicious attacks or breaches.
  
I faced a lot of challenges in deciding which parts of the stack to focus and work on during the development of this first enhancement, but making a tracking file for myself to monitor my progress and tasks left to do helped keep me focused and allowed me to analyze and restructure my later development plans.

Another challenge came in finding and using recommended technologies as some of them I have not been exposed to and so created a bit of a learning curve, however I was able to use references from the internet and previous coursework to adapt to this obstacle.
