## Professional Self Assessment

The work that I have completed in this computer science program has helped me think more practically about applications of computer science in the real world and how to execute them. Much of the work done across this program has emphasized their relation to real world problems and types of solutions while also introducing and reinforcing the importance of industry standards. This includes small team collaborations in my time at a previous institution where each member took responsibility for a certain feature in the final application and used version control and collaborative software like git and Trello to track progress and note features to be developed further. These groups would meet regularly to discuss ongoing progress and distribute work on projects like robotics and application development for a navigation application. The experience of working with a group to develop a software solution fostered a structured mindset in dealing with multiple developers and accountability which is important in business settings where projects are worked on by teams rather than single individuals most times. 

Proposals were created during these experiences as well as during courses like System Analysis and Design and Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance where the focus was on designing the structure for a testing suite or structure and development plan for an application or overall system design. The proposals were written with the intention of being shared with stakeholders and were written in a professional manner than also reduced excess technical jargon for other relevant audiences. These courses helped to solidify higher level thinking of software systems and designs as well as bridging communication between different teams.

Certain courses in the program that focused on problem solving using different programming languages allowed me to develop solutions based on the problem given. Concepts in object-oriented programming allowed for structured data that could be manipulated for use in algorithms that either utilized stored data or manipulated it in some way. In introductory programming courses classes were designed to make the flow and communication of data between components simpler as with the mock inventory system developed for the Introduction to Scripting course. These concepts were then built upon further when tying the software functionality of an inventory system with a user interface in Mobile Architecture and Programming. This was also supported by architectural principles like using a singleton structure for control in certain applications requiring a central control structure for interacting with other classes. Databases also presented a new way to interact with data and software by using relational databases and queries to sort, organize, and collate large data sources for further analysis and presentation to businesses. Use of NoSQL databases also showed the strengths of less structured data and how these can be more convenient in applications looking for more scalability and less uniformity in how certain data is presented. These aspects of the program resonated with me the most and strengthened my problem-solving mindset and helped me realize that this is the main principle in computer science that I want to continue to build upon and utilize in the field.

Throughout the whole program, security was a concept pushed in every aspect to make the inclusion and consideration almost second nature. Security concepts included using static testing tools to analyze included dependencies for potential concerns as well as doing manual code reviews to identify areas of weak architecture or design that could lead to security risks. I was later introduced to authentication and authorization concepts to help secure endpoints and enforce role-based access control as well as self-signed certificates to ensure authenticated users were also authorized to access functions of the application. Security was not something I had a lot of exposure to or consideration for prior to beginning the program and so this introduced a new skillset that would be relevant in almost every project to come.

Reflections on work done over the computer science program have also shown me the amount of growth that has occurred over this time and has also strengthened my ability to reflect on my work as well as strengths and areas for improvement. Continuous learning and improvements are large aspects of the computer science field as a whole and are important skills to continue to develop once I start my work experience. 

The artifact present in this portfolio represents a combination of the various course outcomes in a single artifact, a full stack application. This application incorporates aspects of software design and engineering in the planning for the application and the creation of the necessary components to allow for functionality in the application. Algorithms were incorporated to generate test data for later use in templating structures to allow for dynamic representation of information from the data rather than hard coding each element individually. This was then expanded upon with a connection to the database to store the data long term. While incomplete overall, areas of improvement for this piece were also identified with considerations made from the initial code review and diagrams of the needs of the overall application and what items were missing or could be reworked in the future.

## Enhancement Category 1: Software Design and Engineering

The initial artifact for this submission was a package of files used in developing test cases for CS 320. This package was the final submission for that class and was completed in December of 2024. I chose to include this artifact in my portfolio because I felt that it was the most fleshed out piece of work that I had from a previous course that I could build upon. This artifact proved to be a basis for me in developing a final enhancement plan based on these initial classes and the structure of the information and methods. This resulted in the decision to create a full stack application for all three categories based loosely on these initial classes. The initial artifact has yet to be improved as I realized during development for this stage that much of the class structure resembles the data model and intended schema for the information that will be help in the database. Since the intention is for the application to be a full stack application, a front end and framework had to be developed which was the focus of this first enhancement. By creating this front facing user interface and creating a full stack framework, I have made it easier to further improve on the artifact by translating the classes and methods to data models and routing methods that can later be used with a database to translate these classes into a practical application.
  
I did not fully meet the intended enhancement goals that I had set for this enhancement of translating the original classes into JavaScript as the resemblance to a data model made it more fitting for the second category enhancement. Instead, the focus became designing and developing a basic user side with elements to accept user input and further process queries or requests. Not all of this functionality was completed, in particular the design of the dropdown menu for the search component, but the ability to rapidly develop the artifact to this point was a large accomplishment. 

The amount of design left to do with the UI elements themselves led me to leave more complex designs for later development and so my intention is to continuously update the interface as I continue developing the artifact for the remaining two categories.

Looking at the course outcomes, I showed my ability to design visual communications through data flow diagrams and ER diagrams, such as the one below and also demonstrated a learning mindset and concerns for best practices by researching industry technologies and standards for testing and authentication in a full stack, and noting any results of my research in my informal tracker.

Security was also at the forefront of my concerns in planning for proper authentication set up before connecting the database or publishing the site to prevent malicious attacks or breaches.
  
I faced a lot of challenges in deciding which parts of the stack to focus and work on during the development of this first enhancement, but making a tracking file for myself to monitor my progress and tasks left to do helped keep me focused and allowed me to analyze and restructure my later development plans.

Another challenge came in finding and using recommended technologies as some of them I have not been exposed to fully and so created a bit of a learning curve, however I was able to use references from the internet and previous coursework to adapt to this obstacle.

## Enhancement Category 2: Algorithms and Data Structure

This category saw a continued development of the full stack application from the first category enhancement. I chose to continue developing this artifact to demonstrate my ability to integrate multiple computer science competencies within a single project. This enhancement added a [model schema](https://github.com/Krystal-G116/CS_499_Tracker/blob/final/app_api/models/vehicles.js) for defining a Mongoose schema to be used with MongoDB in the application stack. Controllers and views were then used to include the test data set and display them in the view using vairables in the template. The seed file is found in `/models/seed.js` and takes a trimmed version of the original dataset `used_car_data_trimmed.csv` and extracts relevant elements to create an instance of the Vehicle model.

Data provided by user [Ananaymital](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ananaymital/us-used-cars-dataset?resource=download) on kaggle.

A short script was created to aid in the further development of the front end of the application by creating dynamic responses to components on the home page.

My enhancement for this milestone demonstrated my ability to come up with solutions for simple problems using algorithms and templating. I plan to develop this further as I include database elements and queries. My use of other dependencies showed my ability to work with different syntax and components to create a single project. My design of the vehicle schema demonstrated an understanding for data structure, as well as identification of where additional data may need to be stored. Using a subset of test data before database integration also showed an understanding for conserving resources and establishing functionality with test data prior to database integration. My focus throughout the enhancements has also been to continuously deliver increasing functionality with each day of work and through this process I am also demonstrating my ability to work within a continuous development project effectively. While I still intend to have authentication, authorization, and elements of RBAC within the system for security, I was waiting for integration with the database to also test saving and securing user data. I can improve on the current enhancement to further reach this outcome by ensuring data entered at point of input are validated and protected from XSS.

As I was improving the artifact, I began to have more of an appreciation for the continuous development environment and Agile approaches to development. While I am neglecting to use many of the standard forms of planning and input from an outside client, I do believe that I am maintaining the mindset of continuous user side functionality and flexibility in design and development, especially with a small single person project. Struggles I have faced in considering design elements during the enhancement were times when I referenced some real sites, for examples on current feel for designs related to the type of application I am prototyping. I do still struggle with continuous documentation of the artifact as I continue development but I am hoping to get critical elements referenced and commented before polishing.

## Enhancement Category 3: Databases

The artifact developed for this milestone is a continuation of the artifact developed in the previous two milestones. The overall artifact is an example of a full-stack application for a possible vehicle rental service. I chose to continue this artifact’s development and include it in my e-Portfolio because the prototype application incorporates aspects of software design, data structures and algorithms, and databases.

The design of the user interface, application structure, and development process demonstrated my skills in design of a large project. While my more Agile approach to development of this application also showcased my ability to work in fast paced environments, my ability to balance development with other life factors showed how quickly I can be derailed. The data structures developed to describe the vehicles in the rental application and the algorithms used to extract and display data to the user demonstrated my ability to take advantage of integrated solutions within software used in the application. These previous enhancements lended themselves well to connecting with a database which was the focus of the improvement for this milestone. For this milestone I used the sample data that I had trimmed to seed a database for the vehicles. From here I created an API to handle data communication between the database and the main application and verified this in the console and by accessing data in from the main application. I later used this data to improve upon another client view to display a listing of available vehicles. These were the initial improvements but with the foundation in place, including other data structures and routes should be simple.

During my intial enhacnement plan I had hoped to meet the outcomes related to database solutions and developing with security in mind, however I did not implemented the authentication or role-based access control to API methods to access the database. I intend on including these improvements in future developments to polish this artifact. As I was improving the artifact it allowed me to consider more the use of a potential single page application for certain views within the application to reduce the amount of repeated calls to the database to access data in different views.
